Overview: Web Browser-based student note-taking app. 

Description: This project is a web-based browser note-taking app. The note-taking app is marketed towards Students. It gives current Students an all-in-one place to manually keep track, create, edit, and delete their notes. Rather, the notes are for class or saving lab and homework due dates; this Student Note-taking app is up for the job! The application build allows Students to focus on easily navigating the website and the easy-to-use features such as inputting the information, saving it, having the option to update existing information, and deleting entries upon their choosing. Students have the autonomy for each note entry to be reflected as the user chooses, thus allowing for a user-friendly experience intended for the Student.
